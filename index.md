#  Nie, Lun Yiu  聂麟骁

Hi! I’m Lunyiu Nie, a computer science Master student at Tsinghua University. My research supervisor is [Prof. Jidong Zhai](https://pacman.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~zjd/). My current research interests mainly lie in the intersection of programming language and natural language.

I completed my Bachelor’s Degree study at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, during which I was advised by [Prof. Wai Lam](http://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~textmine/) and [Prof. Helen Meng](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/prof-meng-mei-ling-helen/). Previously I also worked as a research intern at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences supervised by [Prof. Yungang Bao](http://acs.ict.ac.cn/baoyg/) and [Prof. Qun Huang](https://huangqundl.github.io/).
