I‚Äôm Lunyiu Nie, a computer science Master student at Tsinghua University. My research supervisor is [Prof. Jidong Zhai](https://pacman.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~zjd/). My current research interests mainly lie in the intersection of programming language and natural language, including NL-to-code generation (semantic parsing) and code representation learning.

I completed my Bachelor‚Äôs Degree study at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, during which I was advised by [Prof. Wai Lam](http://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~textmine/) and [Prof. Helen Meng](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/prof-meng-mei-ling-helen/). Previously I also worked as a research intern at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences supervised by [Prof. Yungang Bao](http://acs.ict.ac.cn/baoyg/) and [Prof. Qun Huang](https://huangqundl.github.io/).

GraphQ IR: Unifying Semantic Parsing of Graph Query Language with Intermediate Representation

**Lunyiu Nie**, Shulin Cao, Jiaxin Shi, Qi Tian, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li, Jidong Zhai

- Under Review
- TLDR: We propose GraphQ IR, a novel intermediate representation for unifying the semantic parsing of graph query languages (e.g., SPARQL, Cypher, Lambda-DCS, KoPL, etc). Experiments show that our approach can consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks *Overnight*, *KQA Pro* and *MetaQA*, with significant accuracy improvement under compositional generalization and few-shot learning settings. We also implement a source-to-source compiler that can achieve translation among multiple graph query languages.

[KQA Pro: A Dataset with Explicit Compositional Programs for Complex Question Answering over Knowledge Base](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03875)

Shulin Cao, Jiaxin Shi, Liangming Pan, **Lunyiu Nie**, Yutong Xiang, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li, Hanwang Zhang, Bin He

- To appear in _ACL 2022_ (Long Paper)
- TLDR: We introduce KQA Pro, a dataset for complex KBQA including ~120K diverse natural language questions, which is currently also the largest corpus for NLQ-to-SPARQL task. The questions are very diverse and challenging, requiring multiple reasoning capabilities including compositional reasoning, multi-hop reasoning, quantitative comparison, set operations, and etc.

[Code Structure Guided Transformer for Source Code Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09340)

Shuzheng Gao, Cuiyun Gao, Yulan He, Jichuan Zeng, **Lunyiu Nie**, Xin Xia, Michael Lyu

- To appear in _ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)_
- TLDR: We propose SG-Trans to incorporate code structural properties into Transformer. To capture the hierarchical characteristics of code, we inject the local symbolic information (e.g., code tokens) and global syntactic structure (e.g., data flow) into the self-attention module as inductive bias.

[CoreGen: Contextualized Code Representation Learning for Commit Message Generation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2021.05.039)

**Lunyiu Nie**, Cuiyun Gao, Zhicong Zhong, Wai Lam, Yang Liu, Zenglin Xu

- In *Neurocomputing* (2021)
- TLDR: We propose a novel code representation learning method for commit message generation that exploits the contextual information behind code commit sequences. Evaluation on the benchmark shows that our model outperforms over the baseline models with at least 28.18% BLEU-4 score improvement.

[Unstructured Knowledge Access in Task-oriented Dialog Modeling using Language Inference, Knowledge Retrieval and Knowledge-Integrative Response Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06066)

Mudit Chaudhary, Borislav Dzodzo, Sida Huang, Chun Hei Lo, Mingzhi Lyu, **Lunyiu Nie**, Jinbo Xing, Tianhua Zhang, Xiaoying Zhang, Jingyan Zhou, Hong Cheng, Wai Lam, Helen Meng

- In *AAAI-21 DSTC9 Workshop* (2021), Finalist of The 9th Dialog System Technology Challenge (DSTC9) Track 1.
- TLDR: We propose a pipeline framework for task-oriented dialog modeling with unstructured knowledge access. Our framework can significantly improve the performance of dialog systems and generate high-quality responses, achieving at least 58.77% improvement on BLEU-4 score over the baseline.

[ATOM: Commit Message Generation Based on Abstract Syntax Tree and Hybrid Reranking](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2020.3038681)

Shangqing Liu, Cuiyun Gao, Sen Chen, **Lunyiu Nie**, Yang Liu.

- In *IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE)* (2020)
- TLDR: We develop a novel commit message generation model that explicitly incorporates the abstract syntax tree for representing code changes and integrates both retrieved and generated messages through hybrid ranking. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves the state-of-the-art models by 30.72% in terms of BLEU-4.
